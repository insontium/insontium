Hi everybody. I suppose I took the long way around to get here, but glad I finally made it.

In terms of current interestts, I have been immersing myself in the latest macOS security architecture. 

My true passion, however, is with writing --  everything from wry political parody to technical documentation.

I suppose I'll write more once I get the lay of the land and carve out my own bit of git.
